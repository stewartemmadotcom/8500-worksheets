## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: [Brief descriptive title]

**What I was trying to do:**

I was trying to figure out this problem: 

The Gay Guides data is quite large (60,000+ entries). Write a loop that searches through the data and finds the first 5 locations in New York City. Your loop should:
- Use `next` to skip any entries that aren't in New York
- Print each NYC location's title as you find it  
- Use `break` to stop the loop after finding 5 locations (no need to search all 60k rows!)

**What went wrong:**
Nothing was printing when I ran the code, but I was not receiving any errors. 

**My problem-solving process:**
1. 
At first, I thought that I had messed up the counter, since I had not used one yet. So I read a couple stack overflow articles of other people asking questions about counters. However, I could not see an issue with the one I had set up. 
2. 
Next, I decided to test out the code in separate chunks. Instead of using the counter, I ran the code without it (which in theory would loop through the entire data set and return all locations in NY). But nothing was printing. Then, I realized that I was using "New York" instead of the acronym "NY". When I ran it all again with "NY", it worked! 
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: I searched for information on adding a counter to a loop. 
- [ ] Course materials: I referred to the data set and reviewed the terminology it used. 
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ ] Other: [describe]

**Resolution:**
[What ultimately worked or where you're still stuck]
I figured out the counter, I just needed to fix my search from "New York" to "NY". 

**What I learned:**
[What did this teach you about the concept, the tool, or problem-solving?]
Sometimes, the only issue is making sure you know how the data set is structured, and not the code itself. It is helpful to look back at the data set to double check wording. Additionally, separating the code into smaller bits helped me figure out what piece was actually wrong.
