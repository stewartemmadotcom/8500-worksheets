## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: Figure out the floor function

**What I was trying to do:**
In the worksheet from this week, one of the prompts was to describe the floor function. 

**What went wrong:**
Despite reading the documentation for floor, I was still confused. 

**My problem-solving process:**
1. I attempted to read the documentation for floor, but I still didn't really understand what it did. 
2. I googled the floor function and read an article on geeksforgeeks.org that simplified the explanation. 
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [x] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ ] Course materials: [which ones]
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [x] Other: [describe] Google 

**Resolution:**
The website that I found explained the floor function to me in more simple terms, and I was able to understand what it does. 

**What I learned:**
I learned that sometimes the documentation is written in a way that is confusing, but that I can still easily figure out functions through a quick google search.

### Challenge 2: Figuring out the oldest and youngest ages in a data set 

**What I was trying to do:**
When tinkering with the BostonWomenVoters data set, I wanted to figure out the age range of voters. Because I had just learned the min/max functions, I figured I could use those on the age column. However, when I executed the code, the value returned was NA. 

**What went wrong:**
I kept getting the value NA rather than a number. 

**My problem-solving process:**
1. I returned to the documentation for min/max functions, but I could not figure out why I was still getting NA. 
2. I googled my issue and found a reddit post that described how to remove NA from R's query. 
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [x] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ ] Course materials: [which ones]
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [X] Other: [describe] Google 

**Resolution:**
In the code, rather than just putting something like 
max(BostonWomenVoters$Age) 

I instead put this 

max(BostonWomenVoters$Age, na.rm = TRUE) 

**What I learned:**
Here, I learned how to remove NA from the query so that r would return an actual value.

## Reflection

**What I understand well now:**
I feel like I have a good grasp of the R basics we learned this week, as well as how to search for solutions to the challenges I run into. I particularly enjoyed querying the data sets. 

**What I'm still confused about:**
Although I feel like I have a good grasp of the basics, I am curious if there is a way to query the data and at the same time set the answer of the query to a variable. 

**Connection to historical research:**
Being able to quickly query large datasets seems like it could come in handy during research. 
For example, when I was able to query the data set to find the age range of women in BostonWomenVoters. 
If I was using a more geographically diverse data set, I would also likely be able to figure out the percentage of voters from a certain area quickly.
