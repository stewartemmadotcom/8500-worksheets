## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: [Brief descriptive title]

**What I was trying to do:**
In the gay guides data set, I was trying to find all locations in California during the 1970s. 

**What went wrong:**
I was able to separately find all locations in California and all locations in the 1970s, but I could not seem to figure out how to combine them. 

**My problem-solving process:**
1. [First attempt - what you did and what happened]
    I referred to my notes from class looking for a solution but had no luck. 
2. [Second attempt - what you did and what happened]
    I googled subsetting data bases and reread the documentation/assignment for this week, but again did not figure it out. 
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]
    I consulted with Chase to see how he figured it out. I realized that I needed to create a new data frame with the rows from the 1970s and then subset THAT data frame to further filter it to the rows from CA. 

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [x] Course materials: [which ones] Notes/assigned reading material on Objects, Types, and Useful R Functions 
- [x] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [x] Other: [describe] Collaboration with other student (Chase) 

**Resolution:**
[What ultimately worked or where you're still stuck]
Talking through the issue with Chase led me to realize that I was missing the step of creating a new data set with the first set of information and then subsetting that data to find the second set of information. 
**What I learned:**
[What did this teach you about the concept, the tool, or problem-solving?]
Talking with others who are working through the same problems is very helpful. I also feel like I have a greater understanding of how data frames work in R now.
